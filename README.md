# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built-in Neighborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - I decided to create an image based off one of my favorite pokemon which is Charmander. Charmander is a pokemon that is classified as a fire type pokemon, hence why Charmander has a fire on its tail.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

    - The first thing I am proud on is that I was able to code the painting of Charmander exactly how I wanted it to look. Even though it took me many tries and many methods, I am also proud that my code contains no syntax errors and runs flawlessly. 
3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Something that I would like to do differently if I had the opportunity is to add more details in the background of my painting. I spent too much time on the pokemon itself, I did not have anytime to work on the background.
